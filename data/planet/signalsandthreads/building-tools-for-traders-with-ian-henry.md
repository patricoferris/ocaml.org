<p>Ian Henry started his career at Warby Parker and Trello, building consumer apps for millions of users.

In this episode, Ron and Ian explore what it’s like writing code at a company that has been “on its own parallel universe software adventure for the last twenty years.” Along the way, they go on a tour of Ian’s whimsical and sophisticated side projects—like Bauble, a playground for rendering trippy 3D shapes using signed distance functions—that have gone on to inform his work: writing typesafe frontend code for users who measure time in microseconds and prefer their UIs to be “six pixels high.”</p><p>You can find the transcript for this episode on our <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/building-tools-for-traders" target="_blank">website</a>.</p><p>Some links to topics that came up in the discussion:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bauble.studio/">Bauble studio</a></li><li><a href="https://janet.guide/"><i>Janet for Mortals</i>, by Ian Henry</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/the-joy-of-expect-tests/">What if writing tests was a joyful experience?</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>
